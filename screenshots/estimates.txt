1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage : 1-2 minutes:
    Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another AZ when we set Multi-AZ = YES. Time it takes for the failover to complete depends on the DB activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable.
	Failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds.
 	If it is large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage : 15-30 mins:
    The support staff needs to manually promote the read replica in the secondary region to the primary database, need to update the application DB url with the new one.
	If this happens at night, we should safely assume that it takes at-least 5 mins for someone to getup and login to AWS console, 
	15-20 mins to actually fix the issue.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage : 0 mins:
    We have a synchronous standby copy of the primary database, no data lose.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage : 0 mins:
    Because we already have replica in another region, there would be no data loss.
